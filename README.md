# Telecom_Churn
This project features an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of customer churn. It preprocesses data and uses visualizations to reveal that month-to-month contracts, electronic check payments, and a lack of security services significantly drive churn, while longer contracts and automatic payments boost retention.
